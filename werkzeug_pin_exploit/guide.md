# BASIC REQUIREMENTS:
1. LFI
2. Path to access debugger CLI after token creation

---

# How token is generated:
The app takes several information, creates an md5 or SHA1 hash from it, then encode the resulting digest as a 9-digit decimal number, with hyphens inserted every 3 digits.
The information it takes:
1. user name under which the application is running
2. Module name *Ex. flask.app, werkzeug.debug*
3. Application name *Ex. wsgi_app, DebuggedApplication, Flask*
4. Path to the Flask app
5. Mac address stripped of colons and in decimal format
    ```python
    print(mac_address)
    ```
6. machine id
7. cgroup

---

# Methods to find each information with LFI:
1. User name:
    a. Method 1: directly given in /proc/self/environ
